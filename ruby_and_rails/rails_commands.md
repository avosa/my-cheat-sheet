# Rails Commands

## Important commands

- start a local server
```bash
rails s
```

- print routes & paths of application
```bash
rails routes
# check specific route based on prefix
rails routes | grep _new
```

- console to crash test models
```bash
rails c
# console to test models without affecting the db
rails c --sandbox
```


## Install gems

- Installing gems in `sudo` will install it in the root (for all users) - Not recommended!
- It gives access to your computer to possible malicious code

```bash
curl ...
bundle install
yarn add bootstrap

# show what gems are installed
gem list  
# get info about the path where the gem is installed                  
gem info <gem_name> 
# uninstall a specific gem     
gem uninstall <gem_name>
```

## Rails db tasks

```bash
# drop the database (delete all data)
rails db:drop
# drop the database + create tables found on schema              
rails db:reset             
# create a db with empty schema
rails db:create            
# run pending migrations on db schema
rails db:migrate           
# seed the db
rails db:seed              
# revert last migration
rails db:rollback          
```

## Rails Models

```bash
# generate migration file to create a table / model
rails g model Restaurant name:string           
# generate model with 1:N relationship / foreign key
rails g model Review restaurant:references     

# generate a migration to make a change to a model
rails g migration AddAddressToRestaurants
  add_column :table, :column, :data-type
  change_column
  remove_column
  rename_column
  add_reference
```

## Rails Controllers

```bash
# generate a controller
rails g controller restaurants
```

## Routes

- Rails routes display:
1. prefix (rails path prefix of the associated route)
2. verb (HTTP verb of the route)
3. URL pattern (path to the route)
4. Controller#Action (targeted controller and method)

```ruby
root to: 'pages#home'

get 'restaurants', to: 'restaurants#index'
get 'restaurants/:id', to: 'restaurants#show', as: :restaurant

get 'about', to 'pages#about'

resources :brands, only: [:index, :show] do
  resources :products, only: [:index, :show]
end
```

## 7 CRUD actions

index / show / new / create / edit / update / destroy
get   / get  / get / post   / get  / patch  / delete


## HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

### VERB

REST pattern |   CRUD pattern (used to speak with db)

GET          |   Read
POST         |   Create
PATCH        |   Update
DELETE       |   Delete

### URL

http    ://   www.google.com/       search?    q=wagon&hl=en
----          -----------------     -------    -------------
scheme        damin name / host     path       query string

### Headers

browser > inspect > network > headers

### Body

- With a `GET` request, there is no body (just request info - URL + Headers)
- With `POST` and `PATCH` requests, we have a body (usually with content from a form)
- JSON with keys and values

## Tags

```bash
# write ruby code
<% %> | er + tab         
# write ruby code and inject output in HTML
<%= %> |Â pe + tab         

<%= link_to 'about', about_path %> | it + tab

_ form.html.erb
<%= render 'form', restaurtant: @restaurant %>
```

:wq                   
# force quit (without saving)
